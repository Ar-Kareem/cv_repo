Any practical use case of an LLM that includes databases with multiple access levels introduces a possible security risk to the system. While multiple works providing possible methods to ’detoxify’ or add guardrails to LLMs exist, those methods can provide no provable guarantee of not leaking data. We extend on our prior published work, SecureLLM, which is an approach that guarantees security with no data leakage by composing appropriate fine-tuned models. The power of SecureLLM relies heavily on the fine-tuned models used for composition, thus we present a thorough analysis and benchmarking of several widespread LLM fine-tuning techniques, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the approach compared to an insecure generalized model trained on all the data which acts as an upper bound in performance. We present results showing that our SecureLLM composition can get close to the performance of the generalized model and sometimes match it under a distributional shift. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center text-right" style="margin-top:0.75cm; margin-bottom:0.75cm;"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <h2 class="project_title">Numerical Modelling of Aircraft Evacuations</h2> <p class="description">The FAA regulation for safe aircraft evacuations requires a demonstration under specific conditions. The current demonstrations are performed without any computational models aiding the design prior to live testing. This project demonstrates how a numerical model can be used to simulate a much wider range of conditions to aid designers in picking a single design to proceed with. Our numerical model is created as an equivalent circuit with non-linear constitutive equations. Employing the model on an example baseline configuration shows the location of bottlenecks and the relative impact of obstacles in the evacuation path. When paired together, a physical demonstration and numerical model can more effectively ensure that an aircraft is capable of a safe evacuation in all conditions, compared to a physical demonstration alone. </p> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/cv_repo/assets/img/EVACUATION2-480.webp 480w,/cv_repo/assets/img/EVACUATION2-800.webp 800w,/cv_repo/assets/img/EVACUATION2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="250px"></source> <img src="/cv_repo/assets/img/EVACUATION2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="project thumbnail" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center text-left" style="margin-top:0.75cm; margin-bottom:0.75cm;"> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/cv_repo/assets/img/VQA2-480.webp 480w,/cv_repo/assets/img/VQA2-800.webp 800w,/cv_repo/assets/img/VQA2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="250px"></source> <img src="/cv_repo/assets/img/VQA2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="project thumbnail" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <h2 class="project_title">Binary Visual Question Answering using Transformers with raw inputs</h2> <p class="description">In this work, we introduce the Visual-Question-Answering task and the balanced binary visual-question-answering dataset.

On the other hand, more traditional models have been widely used for part of speech tagging, exemplified by parsers such as the Stanford Parser, and the part of speech taggers available in the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. We evaluate the accuracy of several models and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach for part of speech tagging.

Despite this challenge, the paper demonstrates that these models exhibit a robust conceptual understanding, enabling inference and fluent text generation. Our presentation summarizes the key findings of the paper and then introduces original experiments that explore this alignment further. Our results reveal both supporting evidence that confirms the paper’s findings and contrasting outcomes that highlight areas of disagreement. </p> </div> </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 Abdulrahman Alabdulkareem. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/cv_repo/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/cv_repo/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/cv_repo/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/cv_repo/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/cv_repo/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/cv_repo/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/cv_repo/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/cv_repo/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> </body> </html>
