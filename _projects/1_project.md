title: Poisson Equation Solver in Transformed Space
description: Solving the Poisson equation is a critical task in almost all engineering fields, where it models countless phenomena like gravity and electrical potential. Many different Poisson equation solvers exist, but they rarely support solving the equation in a transformation on curved space. This publicly available project solves that problem by introducing an easy-to-use and lightweight Poisson equation solver implemented in Python that supports curved spaces, available on PyPI and GitHub. The solver supports Neumann, Dirichlet, and mixed boundary conditions, and is designed for ease of use, requiring less than 10 lines of code to set up and execute.
